# Implementation Overview

This document explains the files added and the edits made to transform the starter project into a simple Study Planner app with Today/Calendar/Settings, local storage, and a minimal reminder simulation.

## Added Files

- lib/models/task.dart
  - Defines the `Task` model with fields: id, title, description?, dueDate, reminderTime?, isCompleted, createdAt
  - Provides `toJson`/`fromJson` for persistence and `copyWith` for updates

- lib/services/storage_service.dart
  - `StorageService` wraps `SharedPreferences` CRUD for tasks
  - Stores a JSON-encoded list of tasks under a single key

- lib/screens/today_screen.dart
  - Shows a list of tasks due today
  - Floating Action Button opens a bottom-sheet `TaskForm` to create tasks
  - Supports marking tasks complete and deleting

- lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart
  - Monthly grid calendar with month navigation
  - Highlights dates with tasks (dot indicator)
  - Shows tasks for the selected date in a list below the grid

- lib/screens/settings_screen.dart
  - Reminder toggle persisted in `SharedPreferences`
  - Shows storage method and app version
  - Simulates enabling reminders via a SnackBar (no real scheduling yet)

- lib/widgets/task_card.dart
  - Reusable UI widget to display a task with complete/delete actions

- lib/widgets/task_form.dart
  - Bottom-sheet form to create a task (title, optional description, due date, optional reminder time)

## Modified Files

- pubspec.yaml
  - Added dependencies:
    - `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2`
    - `intl: ^0.19.0`
    - kept `cupertino_icons`

- lib/main.dart
  - Replaced previous sample screen with a Material 3 scaffold and `NavigationBar`
  - Added `HomeScaffold` with three tabs: Today, Calendar, Settings
  - Imports new screens

- README.md
  - Rewrote to describe implemented features, structure, running instructions (including Windows toolchain note), limitations, and improvements

## Removed/Deprecated

- lib/screens/screens.dart
  - Not used by the new app structure. The previous sample `Bumbogo` grid view is replaced by the Study Planner navigation and screens. (File still exists in repo; safe to delete if no longer needed.)

## Behavioral Summary

- Task creation: via `TaskForm` in Today screen bottom sheet
- Task display: Today lists tasks due today; Calendar lists tasks for selected date and marks days with tasks
- Task actions: Toggle complete and delete from Today list
- Persistence: All tasks read/written through `StorageService` using `SharedPreferences`
- Settings: Toggle for simulated reminders; basic app/storage info

## Known Gaps (Future Work)

- Real notifications (e.g., `flutter_local_notifications`) instead of SnackBar simulation
- Edit task flow (change title/description/date/reminder)
- Filtering/sorting and search
- Calendar polish (weekday headers, improved out-of-month day styling)
- State management (Provider/Riverpod/Bloc) and unit/widget tests

## Run Notes

- Run `flutter pub get` after dependency changes
- On Windows desktop, ensure Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload is installed, then `flutter run -d windows`
